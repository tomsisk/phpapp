MODELQUERY UNIT TESTS
---------------------

In order run the unit tests, ModelQuery must have access to a MySQL database.
Make sure you have the PHP MySQL module installed, and then customize the
connection information for your test database by creating a file in this
directory named "local.inc.php", which contains the following lines:

<?php
define('DB_HOST', <your-database-host>);
define('DB_USER', <your-database-user>);
define('DB_PASS', <your-database-pass>);
define('DB_NAM', <your-database-name>);

After configuring these settings, run the following command to run unit
tests:

	php test.php
