PHPAPP EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION

This directory contains a skeleton implemention of a PHPApp-enabled
application.

Directory structure/notes:

example
 |- www			- The Apache public web site root.
 |- admin		- The Apache admin site root.
 |- apache		- Sample Apache configuration directives.
 |- config		- Sample PHPAPP config files.
 |- lib			- Application shared code.
 | \- modules	- The PHPAPP application modules.
 \- sql			- The database initialization SQL.

SETUP:

1) Copy all directory contents to a new location.  Be sure you
   do not copy the ".svn" directory entries.  Note that there
   are some hidden files in some directories (i.e. www/.htaccess).

2) Customize the module path to fit your application.  Ideally in
   a production app, they would be located somewhere like
   "lib/myappname/modules" instead of just "lib/modules".

3) Create a new MySQL database for your application.

4) Run the SQL script "sql/phpapp-example.sql" on your new database.

5) Configure "config/default.inc.php" to use your database settings.
   You can also create a "local.inc.php" in the app root to override
   and configuration settings in your development environment.

6) If you moved your modules directory, update the "modules"
   configuration variable in "config/default.inc.php".  Make
   sure the path listed is accessible from PHP's include_path
   specified in the Apache environment.

7) Customize the Apache configuration (apache/phpapp-example.conf)
   to point to the correct directories, and add the new virtual host
   to your Apache installation.

8) Go to http://<your-new-site>/admin and login as "admin" / "password"
