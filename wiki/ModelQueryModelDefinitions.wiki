=Create Model Definitions=

"Model Definitions" are PHP files that contain configuration directives
that tell ModelQuery how to map the database data to PHP objects, so that
you can easily query for and traverse relationships between records.

Let's take a simple example, from the "actors" table from the previous step:

{{{
class Actor extends Model {
	public function configure() {
		$this->id = new IntegerField('ID', array('pk' => true));
		$this->name = new CharField('Name', 255, array('required' => true));
	}
}
}}}

All of your model definitions will extend the base class
[http://home.jongsma.org/software/modelquery/docs/phpdoc/modelquery/Model.html Model].
When ModelQuery initializes your model definitions, it calls the configure()
method to setup the object, which you must override in your model definition.
This is where all the configuration happens.

The first line of the method creates a field mapping to the "id" field from
the database.  Let's analyze the line in question:

_$this->id_: This tells modelquery what the database field name is - "id"
_new IntegerField(...)_: This defines the type of data that the field contains - an integer
_'ID'_: The first parameter to a field object is always a human-readable description
_array('pk' => true)_: All field objects take an "options" parameter.  This is an
array of configuration options for the field.  The positioning of this parameter
depends on the field type.  For IntegerField, it is the second parameter; for
CharField, it is the third
