=Setting Up the Administration Interface=

PHPApp's best feature is the ability to quickly create beautiful and
easy to use administration interfaces.

_If you have copied the example app, this section is just
for reference - your admin site should already be up a running._

Let's look at the directory that will serve as our admin
root.  In the example app, this is the
[http://code.google.com/p/phpapp/source/browse/trunk#trunk%2Fphpapp%2Fexample%2Fadmin admin]
directory.  For your own admin site, you should copy the contents of that
directory into your own web application root.  The function of each file
is described below:

  # *.htaccess*: Contains Apache rewrite rules for properly routing requests through the admin controller
  # *index.php*: The main PHP script that process all requests

You can view an example of configuring Apache to host the admin site
in [http://code.google.com/p/phpapp/source/browse/trunk/phpapp/example/apache/phpapp-example.conf phpapp-example.conf].

Once you've added your virtual host to Apache and loaded the initial database
data from [http://code.google.com/p/phpapp/source/browse/trunk/phpapp/example/sql/phpapp-example.sql phpapp-example.sql],
you should be able to login with admin / password and start editing users
and groups.

So setting up an admin site with pre-configured modules is a snap.
Configuring your content modules for the admin interface is a bit more
complex, so let's go ahead and [PHPAppModelAdmin configure our ModelAdmin definitions].
