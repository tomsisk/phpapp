=Setting Up the Administration Interface=

PHPApp's best feature is the ability to quickly create beautiful and
easy to use administration interfaces.

_If you have copied the example app, this section is just
for reference - your admin site should already be up a running._

The admin site root should contain two files:
  # *.htaccess*: Contains Apache rewrite rules for properly routing requests through the admin controller
  # *index.php*: The main PHP script that process all requests

These can be found in the
[http://code.google.com/p/phpapp/source/browse/trunk#trunk%2Fphpapp%2Fexample%2Fadmin admin]
directory of the sample app.  For your own admin site, you should copy the contents
of that directory into your own web application root.

All that's left is to configure Apache to host the admin site.  You can view
an Apache configuration example in [http://code.google.com/p/phpapp/source/browse/trunk/phpapp/example/apache/phpapp-example.conf phpapp-example.conf].
Once you've added your virtual host to Apache and loaded the initial database
data from [http://code.google.com/p/phpapp/source/browse/trunk/phpapp/example/sql/phpapp-example.sql phpapp-example.sql],
you should be able to login with admin / password and start editing users
and groups.

Setting up an admin site with pre-configured modules is a snap.
Configuring your content modules for the admin interface is a bit more
complex, so let's go ahead and [PHPAppModelAdmin configure our ModelAdmin definitions].
