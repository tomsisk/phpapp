Now that we've loaded some objects into the database, how do we remove them?

Removing a single object is simple: just load the object and call delete():

{{{
$film = $film->get(1);
$film->delete();
}}}

However, you can also bulk-delete any object that matches a query, by
simple calling QueryFilter::delete() at the end of a filter chain:

{{{
// Filter by director 1
$films = $fq->filter('director', 1);

// Delete all of director 1's films from the database
$films->delete();
}}}

Deleting objects *_PERMANENTLY REMOVES THEM_* from your data store.
As you would guess, this has the potential to be disastrous if you do
not construct your query properly.  A call like:

{{{
$fq->delete();
}}}

would delete all films from the database - so be very careful how
you use it.
