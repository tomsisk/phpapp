=Configure the Query Factory=

[http://home.jongsma.org/software/modelquery/docs/phpdoc/modelquery/QueryFactory.html QueryFactory]
is your entry point to ModelQuery.  All operations in ModelQuery start with getting a
query handler from !QueryFactory.

Configuring your !QueryFactory is simple - all you need is an ADODB connection object
and a list of directories that contain your model definitions.

Example of a shared include the creates a !QueryFactory for an app:

{{{
<?php
require_once('adodb/adodb.inc.php');
require_once('modelquery/QueryFactory.class.php');

// 'mysqlt' is strongly recommended for transactional support
$conn = ADONewConnection('mysqlt');
$conn->setFetchMode(ADODB_FETCH_ASSOC);
$conn->autoCommit = false;
$conn->Connect($host, $user, $pass, $dbname);

// You can pass a list of model source directories
$qf = new QueryFactory($conn, array('/my/model/directory'))
}}}

That's all there is to it.  Then to fetch a query handler, simply
access it as a property of QueryFactory:

{{{
$actorQuery = $qf->Actor;
}}}

This assumes you have an "Actor" model defined; we'll get into that in
the next section, where we look at [ModelQueryModelDefinitions creating model definitions].
