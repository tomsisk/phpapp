=Creating a New PHPApp Project=

PHPApp includes a bare-bones example application, that includes
some basic modules like user and group administration.  If you're
creating a new application, the easiest way to get up and running
is to just copy this sample application.

The sample application is located in
[http://code.google.com/p/phpapp/source/browse/trunk#trunk%2Fphpapp%2Fexample phpapp/example]
in SVN.

==Directory Structure of the Sample Application==

{{{
example
 |- www         - The Apache public web site root.
 |- admin       - The Apache admin site root.
 |- apache      - Sample Apache configuration directives.
 |- config      - Sample PHPAPP config files.
 |- lib         - Shared code (will be added to include_path).
 | \- example   - Your application's code.
 |   \- modules - Your application's modules.
 \- sql         - The database initialization SQL.
}}}

==Setting Up a New Application==

 # Copy all directory contents to a new location.  Note that there are some hidden files in some directories (i.e. www/.htaccess).
 # Create a new MySQL database for your application, and load the SQL script "sql/phpapp-example.sql" into your new database.
 # Configure "config/default.inc.php" to use your database settings.
 # Customize the Apache configuration (apache/phpapp-example.conf):
   * Update php_value include_path directives to point to the correct directories
   * Use the correct !ServerName for your machine (defaults to localhost)
 # Add the following directive to your main Apache configuration: `Include /path/to/phpapp/example/apache/phpapp-example.conf`
 # Go to http://localhost/admin and login as "admin" / "password"

If the admin site comes up in your browser, your application is ready to
customize, so let's [PHPAppModules create a content module].
