=Quick Start Guide=

PHPApp includes a bare-bones example application, that includes
some basic modules like user and group administration.  If you're
the type that doesn't want directions, or have had some experience
with PHPApp before, you can follow the steps below to get a new
application up and running in a few minutes.

The sample application is located in
[http://code.google.com/p/phpapp/source/browse/trunk#trunk%2Fphpapp%2Fexample phpapp/example]
in SVN.  With this directory:

 # Copy all directory contents to a new location.  Be sure you do not copy the ".svn" directory entries.  Note that there are some hidden files in some directories (i.e. www/.htaccess).
 # Customize the module path to fit your application.  Ideally in a production app, they would be located somewhere like "lib/myappname/modules" instead of just "lib/modules".
 # Create a new MySQL database for your application.
 # Run the SQL script "sql/phpapp-example.sql" on your new database.
 # Configure "config/default.inc.php" to use your database settings.  You can also create a "local.inc.php" in the app root to override and configuration settings in your development environment.
 # If you moved your modules directory, update the "modules" configuration variable in "config/default.inc.php".  Make sure the path listed is accessible from PHP's include_path specified in the Apache environment.
 # Customize the Apache configuration (apache/phpapp-example.conf) to point to the correct directories, and add the new virtual host to your Apache installation.
 # Go to !http://_your-new-site.com_/admin and login as "admin" / "password"
